abstract: In this paper, we introduce two advancements in the automatic keyphrase
  extraction (AKE) space - KeyGames and pke+. KeyGames is an unsupervised AKE framework
  that employs the concept of evolutionary game theory and consistent labelling problem
  to ensure consistent classification of candidates into keyphrase and non-keyphrase.
  Pke+ is a python based pipeline built on top of the existing pke library to standardize
  various AKE steps, namely candidate extraction and evaluation, to ensure truly systematic
  and comparable performance analysis of AKE models. In the experiments section, we
  compare the performance of KeyGames across three publicly available datasets (Inspec
  2001, SemEval 2010, DUC 2001) against the results quoted by the existing state-of-the-art
  models as well as their performance when reproduced using pke+. The results show
  that KeyGames outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems while generalizing
  better on input documents with different domains and length. Further, pke+′s pre-processing
  brings out improvement in several other system′s quoted performance as well.
